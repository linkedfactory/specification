= LinkedFactory: Industrial Digital Twins

LinkedFactory defines *APIs* and a *JSON-based data format* for managing time series data about assets to create connected digital representations of technical systems.

The core components can be augmented with *RDF-based descriptions* for
representing *metadata* like the structure, components or attributes of
assets as well as other provenance information of time series data.
In this context *SPARQL* can be used to execute queries against time series data and the related metadata.
